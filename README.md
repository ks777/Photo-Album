# Photo Album Project


## Summary
A Java application that serves to simulate a photo album. The program, mainly created as a data structures assignment, incorporates user/password creation, as well as the option to locally save/edit/and view given photos. 

## Purpose
Essentially as part of an assignment that teaches students a bit more into creating simple, multi-layered programs. It definitely helped to learn the java language and working with other students to understand/divide/and work on a project within an allotted time.

## Points of interest/Update
Will be looking into this assignment in the week to come to catch up a bit on Java. (a bit rusty since it's been a while). Will update if need be to fit with current standards, as I do recall it being incomplete in 1-2 areas.
